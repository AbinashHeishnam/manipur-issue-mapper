# 🛣️ AI-Powered Civic Issue Reporting & Red Zone Mapping System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an **AI-powered civic-tech platform** designed to help citizens report local infrastructure and public utility issues such as **road damage, water problems, and garbage management**.

The system aggregates citizen reports, applies **AI-based analysis**, and visualizes problem hotspots as **Red Zones** on a map. Government authorities or administrators can then prioritize and resolve issues based on real-time, data-driven insights.

The project is designed with a **pilot-first, scalable approach**, starting with a small region (e.g., one city or ward in Manipur).

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Enable citizens to report civic issues easily
- Reduce duplicate and fake reports using AI
- Visualize issue density using heatmaps
- Help authorities prioritize problems effectively
- Improve transparency and trust between citizens and government

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement
Traditional civic complaint systems suffer from:
- Delayed response
- Poor visibility of problem severity
- Manual prioritization
- Low transparency

There is no unified, data-driven system that shows **where problems are most critical in real time**.

---

## 💡 Solution
Our platform provides:
- **Citizen Reporting App** (Web/Mobile)
- **AI-powered issue analysis**
- **Red Zone heatmap visualization**
- **Admin/Government dashboard**

Instead of isolated complaints, the system focuses on **aggregated impact**.

---

## 🧠 Core Concept
> Let data decide priority, not manual complaints.

Multiple reports of the same issue increase severity, turning affected areas into **Red Zones**.
